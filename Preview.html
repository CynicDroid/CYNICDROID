                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong><em>ANDROID</em></strong><br>Styles and themes on Android allow you to separate the details of your app design from the UI structure and behavior, similar to stylesheets in web design. A theme is a collection of attributes that's applied to an entire app, activity, or view hierarchy—not just an individual view. When you apply a theme, every view in the app or activity applies each of the theme's attributes that it supports. Themes can also apply styles to non-view elements, such as the status bar and window background.<br><br><em><strong>WINDOWS</strong></em><br>Windows includes several features that enable users to tailor the UI to accommodate their individual needs and preferences. These features include themes, which were introduced in Microsoft Plus! for Windows&nbsp;95. A theme is a user-selectable collection of settings that includes wallpaper, cursors, fonts, sounds, and icons. The following are some characteristics of themes. Theme settings are specified in .theme files that have a format similar to win.ini files. An independent software vendor (ISV) can create and distribute a .theme file with a product. In versions earlier than Windows&nbsp;Vista, theme files are displayed on the Theme tab of the Display control panel. In Windows&nbsp;Vista and later, themes are displayed in the Personalization control panel.<br><br>A visual style is a specification that defines the appearance of the Windows common controls. Visual styles are associated with themes; that is, a .theme file contains a section that specifies the visual style to apply when the particular theme is active. The following are some characteristics of visual styles. Users can change the visual style at any time by selecting a different theme. You must use the visual styles API to apply the currently active visual style to your application's custom or owner-drawn controls, if any. The information that defines a visual style is stored in a .msstyles file. Microsoft does not support the authoring of .msstyles files.&nbsp;<br><strong><em>Visual styles are supported by the following components:</em></strong><br>•Version 6 or later of the common control library (ComCtl32.dll)<br>•The visual styles API implemented in UxTheme.dll<br>•Themes service<br>•One or more visual style definition files (.msstyles)<br><br>The visual styles API depends on a system service called Themes. The common control library queries the Themes service to get style-related information and, up through Windows&nbsp;7, uses the service to render controls in the current visual style. In Windows&nbsp;8 and later, the visual styles API still works if the Themes service is off. This means that the common controls and the non-client area of windows will still have visual styles when the Themes service is off. The Windows&nbsp;8 features that still require the Themes service include: Changing the visual style, typically through the&nbsp;Personalization&nbsp;page of&nbsp;PC Settings. Performance optimizations involved in switching users, logging off, shutting down, and sharing across user sessions. The visual styles API gets style information from the .msstyles file associated with the currently selected theme. The .msstyles file contains a set of metrics, fonts, colors, and bitmaps that define a visual style<br><strong><em>Application Requirements for Supporting Visual Styles: </em></strong><br>•To use visual styles, your application must be running on an operating system that contains ComCtl32.dll version 6 or later. If you want your application to use ComCtl32.dll version 6, you must add an application manifest or compiler directive to specify that version 6 should be used if it is available. If your application contains custom or owner-drawn controls, you need to use the visual styles API to retrieve information about the currently active visual style, and to draw the controls in that style. For Windows versions prior to Windows&nbsp;8, applications typically need to provide two separate code paths for drawing custom and owner-drawn controls. One code path draws the controls when a theme that uses visual styles is active, and another code path draws the controls when the Windows Classic theme or a high contrast theme is active. In Windows&nbsp;8, however, visual styles are always on, so separate theming code paths are not needed. Applications that are manifested for Windows&nbsp;8 get high contrast theming "for free."<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Android developer community is huge, with their biggest feat being the ability to develop custom ROMs or custom Android builds. A custom ROM is an aftermarket firmware production based on the Android source code provided by Google.&nbsp;So if you’re someone who wants to install a custom ROM on your device but are confused about which one to go with, read on as we bring the 15 best custom ROMs for Android in 2021.<br><br><strong><em>Best Custom ROMs for Android (2021)</em></strong><br>The main reason why people prefer custom ROMs is that almost every company drops support for their devices after 2-3 years of their launch. A custom ROM, on the other hand, helps keep your device alive and updated with the latest version of Android.&nbsp;Another reason why people seek custom ROMs is because of the extra features they offer. They also reduce bloatware that comes as a part of many manufacturer skins. While there are many custom ROMs out there, not all of them are stable enough to be used as your daily driver.<br><br>Installing a custom ROM requires you to&nbsp;unlock the bootloader&nbsp;first, and have a custom recovery like TWRP (website)&nbsp;installed. Make sure to always&nbsp;create a backup of your Android device&nbsp;before proceeding. While the download link for officially supported devices is mentioned below, some of these ROMs may have an unofficial port available for other devices as well. Also, on some ROMs, you may have to flash a GApps package such as&nbsp;OpenGapps (website)&nbsp;or NikGApps (website). I have personally tested almost all the ROMs listed below on my Redmi K20 Pro, Poco F1, Mi A1. Also, if you like the custom ROM, consider donating the developer behind the work.<br><br><strong><em>Types of Custom ROMs</em></strong><br><br><strong>1. Pixel Experience</strong><br>Pixel Experience is the best custom ROM for Android right now and I can draw out three reasons for that. First, it&nbsp;supports a huge number of devices from Xiaomi to Realme to Asus to Samsung. Second, it brings Pixel features for non-pixel devices like the newer Google Assistant, built-in GCam support,&nbsp;Pixel live wallpapers,&nbsp;and more.<br>Third, it has amazing stability among all the ROMs that I have tested for years. The main developer, Henrique Pereira, is not in a tearing hurry to port new Android versions to all the devices. Instead, the developer picks a popular and developer-centric device and creates a base. After that, he publishes all the changes to GitHub for other maintainers to work upon. Not to mention,&nbsp;Pixel Experience has maintainers around the world&nbsp;who work round the clock to quell the bugs in a timely manner. So to put it straight, if you want stability and new features right from Pixel devices then Pixel Experience is the best custom ROM on Android, bar none. Keep in mind, you won’t get the latest Android build immediately, but you will have a stable and hassle-free experience for sure.<br><br><strong>2. LineageOS</strong><br>Next is the biggest name in the custom ROM scene – LineageOS. While many of you might not be familiar with the name, LineageOS is actually the same custom ROM that&nbsp;started as&nbsp;CyanogenMod. Back in the fall of 2016, Cyanogen Inc. announced that it was&nbsp;discontinuing development and shut down the infrastructure behind the project. Since then, the developer community has kept the project alive, but under the name of LineageOS. Built on top of Google’s AOSP code and adding their own custom code to it, LineageOS works as a standalone ROM as well as the source code for many other custom ROMs out there. It has the biggest developer team under its name and officially&nbsp;supports over 190 devices. The ROM includes basic but useful features that include but are not limited to customizing the status bar, changing the overall theme, editing the navbar, and much more. While Google’s AOSP is barebones, LineageOS gives it a sense of customizability while maintaining stability. Apart from that, if you want top-notch privacy and security on a custom ROM then I would highly recommend LineageOS. Not to mention, the development team has worked really fast on bringing Android 11 this time and it’s available for several devices.<br><br><strong>3. Evolution X</strong><br>If I were to describe Evolution X, I would say it is the&nbsp;stable version of Resurrection Remix from yesteryear. This is because of the plethora of customization features it offers, and it does so without any loss in the stability of the ROM. Evolution X merges various code snippets into one main project to bring a long list of features and for many devices.&nbsp;While this does mean that updates come a little slower, they are still able to deliver regular updates. Also, Evolution X has its own&nbsp;customization bar&nbsp;from where you can make any system-level changes. It also comes with the Android gesture navigation system out of the box. Lately, the development team behind Evolution X decided to remove certain features from the ROM as those features were not that useful and were slowing down the system. As a result, the latest versions are stable than ever and go easier on the system’s resources.<br><br><strong>4. Corvus OS</strong><br>If you are looking for the&nbsp;best Android custom ROM for PUBG&nbsp;or generally, gaming then Corvus OS is what you need. It’s built on the foundation of Dirty Unicorns and has many features ported right from there. Among the main features, it supports various gaming-centric kernels such as Hydra kernel, Ryzen kernel, and more. You will be able to play games for a much longer time without your device getting hot beyond normal limits. Apart from that, on the&nbsp;customization&nbsp;front too, Corvus OS is packed with features. You have a system accent picker, font customization option, theme scheduling, additional notification, and lock screen features, and much more. So to sum up, Corvus OS is not just a great gaming ROM, but overall a feature-packed ROM as well.<br><br><strong>5. Revenge OS</strong><br>Revenge OS is a fairly new custom ROM in the Android world but has got pretty good traction because it has brought Android 11 builds for a lot of devices. The OS is built on the Android Open Source Project and has&nbsp;kept just the core essentials&nbsp;to keep the system lightweight and clutter-free. But the one thing that puts it in a different position is the way it looks and its design approach. You can create how your quick settings panel should look with various gradients of color, how many tiles do you need, what kind of media controls you want, and much more. In fact, it has brought those abandoned&nbsp;custom clock faces&nbsp;that Google showcased in Android 11 betas. I would say, if you want an Android 11 custom ROM then RevengeOS is a modern and beautiful OS out there and you should give it a try.<br><br><strong>6. Havoc-OS</strong><br>To define Havoc-OS would take up more than a couple of words. In your first run of this ROM, you’d find it similar to just about any other custom ROM out there. Use it for a couple of days, and you literally start experiencing the true beauty of Havoc-OS. One of the&nbsp;first ROMs to successfully implement a truckload of features.&nbsp;It will definitely remind you of Resurrection Remix and Paranoid Android from the past. The added functionalities of Havoc-OS include tons of mods for the&nbsp;Status bar, buttons, lights, gestures, and other various configurations. While at times, it lacks stability, I can surely say that it has the maximum customizability features. So if you want something like Resurrection Remix but with the latest Android version then Havoc-OS will take you right home.<br><br><strong>7. Arrow OS</strong><br>If minimalism is what you’re looking for then Arrow OS is right up your alley. Possibly the&nbsp;lightest and most functional custom ROM&nbsp;out there, the Arrow OS project is based on the AOSP code while adding useful tweaks to it. It’s very similar to the Pixel Experience ROM but brings additional features to the barebone feature list. The most notable features of the Arrow OS project are the inclusion of the Android 10&nbsp;gesture navigation system, Recents in the overview menu, and an option to choose the system accent color. The overview window shows the most used apps and a few other apps that you might use just like Pixel devices. The customizable panel has a gesture replacement and that’s the 3-button navbar and it’s highly useful for users who want the old navigation system back. Other Arrow OS features include&nbsp;a custom dialer, custom Quick Settings tiles, lock screen shortcuts, Privacy Guard from LineageOS, and more. The Arrow OS project offers simple and minimalistic features that end up resulting in a clean and neat interface, that can further be customized if the user wants to.<br><br><strong>8. Bliss ROM</strong><br>Bliss ROM is a new custom ROM in the Android ecosystem but it has huge potential. It not only develops ROMs for smartphones, but also for tablets and Windows devices like Surface Pro. And the overall experience is quite nice as it&nbsp;comes with a customized launcher and desktop mode. While many users might not like this new way of system navigation, one cannot deny the fact that we need different kinds of skins to reshape the boundary of user interface design in custom ROMs. Apart from including certain tweaks to the customizability and functionality, Bliss ROM vastly&nbsp;enhances the overall visual look&nbsp;of your device. It has a separate settings panel called Blissify from where you can change almost everything. Right from themes to animation and lock screen interface. I would say if you want to try something different, do give a shot at Bliss ROM.<br><br><strong>9. Project Sakura</strong><br>We all know how mid-tier&nbsp;Samsung phones&nbsp;lag behind when it comes to enjoying the latest Android OS. And even in the custom ROM world, some years ago, Samsung phones were not supported because of the Exynos chip. However, things have changed and now Project Sakura aims to bring the latest Android build to a plethora of Samsung smartphones. You have got a clean and minimal stock-like user interface with support for both Android 10 and 11 builds. From Galaxy A10 to M40, you have been covered on almost all the popular Samsung devices. And with the Version 4.R update, Project Sakura has brought many visual refinements such as&nbsp;themes, screen locking animation, new fonts, a Magisk module for visual modification, and more. I think if you have got a Samsung smartphone, Project Sakura can be a great place to begin with.<br><br><strong>10. MSM Extended</strong><br>Another ROM that is based on the AOSP Gerrit but has its own custom mods is the MSM Extended. This project came into existence around the time of the Android Pie launch. However, despite being a relatively new project, the ROM has quickly evolved into becoming&nbsp;a very stable and reliable ROM&nbsp;and gives plenty of other competitors a run for their money. The ROM is&nbsp;very similar to OxygenOS&nbsp;and brings a lot of customizability options to the point that you might feel overwhelmed. The ROM recently updated its source code for the latest Android 10 and now they have started digging the Android 11 builds as well. Personally, I feel MSM Extended has too many features, but if you like feature-packed ROMs then you can definitely give it a try.<br><br><strong>11. crDroid</strong><br>Imagine being on your device’s stock ROM, but with slight tweaks here and there that allow you to&nbsp;customize your device without losing out on the Stock stability. Well, that’s crDroid for you. crDroid has been around for some time and it has gained huge popularity among the stock Android enthusiasts. Similar to AOSP Extended, crDroid has an active development team and supports some of the old devices like Redmi Note 5 Pro,&nbsp;Poco F1, and more. It offers the&nbsp;same AOSP experience that’s exclusive to Google’s lineup, along with truly tested features. Since crDroid is based on LineageOS at its base, the performance and battery life is phenomenal. In my experience with this ROM,&nbsp;the battery life was just the same as the stock ROM, but I was able to customize a few things here and there. To put it into better words, think of LineageOS, but with added features and tweaks. Not to mention, the huge list of device support– both new and old.<br><br><strong>12. Paranoid Android</strong><br>After a few years of break, Paranoid Android is back again. In case you don’t know, Paranoid Android was considered&nbsp;one of the most acclaimed custom ROMs of all time. The development team focused on bringing a polished and refined experience while using minimum resources. While it may not boast of the plethora of features and customization features that other ROMs offer, Paranoid Android or PA, does promise a soothing user experience overall. It offers its own version of the quick settings menu, as well as a&nbsp;fully immersive mode for Android. Paranoid Android has long been regarded as the main project from which Google has brought over a lot of features, the biggest feature being the Ambient Mode, which was present in PA as Peek. At this point, Paranoid Android has added support for a long list of smartphones including Xiaomi, OnePlus, Samsung and some Asus devices. So if you own phones from these OEMs, I would highly recommend Paranoid Android to any other ROM on this list.<br><br><strong>13. Syberia OS</strong><br>For people who love stock Android, but want additional features on top, Syberia OS is another Android custom ROM to consider. Built on top of AOSP/CAF, Syberia OS offers almost everything you’d want from your Android phone. Even with all the features that Syberia OS packs, it’s a very stable ROM and offers smooth and lag free performance. You also get the flexibility to customise pretty much everything in the ROM. Syberia OS also supports OTA updates, so when new versions are released for your phone you will receive the updates seamlessly.<br><br><strong>14. Potato Project</strong><br>The Potato Open Sauce Project is brought to you by a team of Indian developers who have adopted the quintessential potato as their choice of name. Even the different versions of the ROM are titled ‘baked potato’, ‘dumaloo’ etc. The ROM boasts a clean and minimal UI, along with feature improvements. You can expect better notch handling, a new and improved volume control system, and yes, over the air updates of course. The ROM is completely open source, so if you have the skill for it, you can fork the project and make your own&nbsp;custom&nbsp;custom ROM out of it.<br><br><strong>15. AOSIP</strong><br>If you’ve even dabbled in the world of Android custom ROMs you would know the meaning of AOSP. Well, AOSIP is the Android Open Source Illusion Project — a custom ROM that lives by the Android motto ‘Be Together, Not the Same’.<br>With AOSIP, you get the AOSP ROM along with a mixture of features handpicked from various other custom ROMs out there. The developers of the AOSIP ROM prioritise stability and quality, so you can rest assured that you’ll not face any major bugs with this ROM. Apart from that you get a ton of features, as well as deep customisation. <br><br>Make More Out of Your Device With the Best Custom ROMs for Android Custom ROMs bring out a new experience to your mobile devices. While no ROM out there will ever be as stable as the stock ROM, having a custom ROM does give you the liberty to sacrifice a few points of stability in order to gain tons of features. As I have been testing custom ROMs for many years, I never stay on a ROM for more than a week, so I’ve tried pretty much every custom ROM there is out there. For your sake, I have cherry-picked the best custom ROMs for Android above.<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><em><strong>Windows OS Versions for the PC&nbsp;</strong><br></em>The initial version of the Windows operating system launched in 1985, introducing users of MS-DOS, the text-based operating system that was then the main Microsoft OS, to graphics and the computer mouse. Windows 1 and a number of subsequent editions essentially would run on top of MS-DOS and rely on DOS for many features rather than running as true standalone operating systems. Windows 95, one of the most-famous early versions, was released in 1995 amid a huge marketing campaign by Microsoft. It introduced the world to the famous Windows Start Menu. It was also the first version to feature Internet Explorer, Microsoft’s first Web browser. Windows ME, released in 2000, was the last to run on top of DOS. The next year, Microsoft released Windows XP, which was used at many businesses for over a decade and received praise by both critics and users alike. Subsequent versions included the less-successful Windows Vista, as well as Windows 7, Windows 8, and the current version for home and office PCs known as Windows 10. Windows 9 does not exist because of the possibility that users and programs, when attempting to determine the software’s version, might confuse it with Windows 95 or Windows 98. Windows 10, released in 2015, offers support for desktops, laptops and tablets. Rather than rolling out another radically different operating system in the near future, Microsoft has stated publicly that it intends to roll out incremental updates to Windows 10 and a release of Windows 11.<br><br><strong><em>Windows OS Versions for Servers</em></strong><br>In addition to making software for home and business PC users, Microsoft has long made software, including versions of Windows, for servers, the high-powered machines that power websites and big companies. In 1993, Microsoft launched what it called Windows NT. It was an operating system designed for servers and high-powered workstations, running code separate from the DOS-based PC versions of Windows available at the time. It was designed to woo corporate users and programmers away from alternative server operating systems like the Unix and VMS families of software. Starting with Windows XP, other versions of Windows would run on code that originated in NT, rather than on top of DOS. In 2000, a new server product was released called the Windows 2000 Server. Subsequent server-oriented versions of Windows would all have Windows Server in their name, all the way through to today’s version, initially known as Windows Server 2016 and now simply called Windows Server. The server operating systems, which generally support more powerful computers and are designed to be used by multiple users at once, are designed for workloads that run in the background rather than directly interfacing with users.<br><br><strong><em>Windows OS Versions for Phones</em></strong><br>Microsoft has released a number of operating systems for smartphones and, before that, for personal data assistants. The earliest versions, released in the late 1990s, used the brand name Windows “CE,” for “compact edition,” and the devices were very low-powered and simple compared to today’s smartphones. Starting in the early 2000s, Windows-powered operating systems were released under the name “Windows Mobile” for phones and PDAs known as pocket PCs. The first to launch with a modern smartphone app store, similar to iPhone and Android offerings, was Windows Mobile 6.5, which was released in 2009. The next year, the company released a new operating system that kept the numbering but, as on Windows Phone 7, changed the word “Mobile” to “Phone.” It introduced a number of unique features, including tiles for individual apps. The software was critically well-received and beloved by some users but failed to gain traction at the level of Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating systems. Windows Phone 8, launched in 2012, was the first to share code with the company’s computer Windows software. In 2014, Windows Phone 8.1 became the first to include Cortana, a voice-powered virtual assistant similar to Apple’s Siri. The latest phone software is known as Windows 10 Mobile, and it’s designed to emphasize its similarities to the desktop OS. It’s only available for a limited number of phones and isn’t widely adopted.<br></p>
